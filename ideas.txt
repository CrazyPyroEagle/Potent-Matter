Energy Node:
  Allows energy transportation over long distances without the use of pipes.
Ion Battery:
  Stores energy by turning it into ions and anti-ions and then magnetically separating the ions from the anti-ions.
  Energy is taken out by colliding an ion with an anti-ion and then the energy produced by the collision is absorbed.
Item Transformer (find better name):
  Transforms items into energy and back so that they can be transported at high speeds.
Fluid Transformer (find better name):
  Transforms fluids into energy and back so that they can be transported at high speeds.
